# REST vs SOAP ‚Äì Technical Notes for Integration Developers

## ‚úÖ What is REST (Representational State Transfer)?

- REST is an **architectural style** for designing networked applications.
- Lightweight, stateless, and simple to implement.
- Uses standard HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`.
- Data is typically exchanged in **JSON** (but XML, HTML, and plain text are also supported).
- No formal contract ‚Äì documentation is optional (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger).

### Example:
```http
GET /customers/123
Host: api.example.com
```

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Smith",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

## ‚úÖ What is SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)?

- SOAP is a **protocol** for exchanging structured information using XML.
- Strictly defined using **WSDL (Web Services Description Language)**.
- Supports **complex operations** and **transactional behavior**.
- Can work over multiple protocols: HTTP, SMTP, JMS.
- Strong support for **security, validation, and reliability**.

### Example:
```xml
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
                  xmlns:cus="http://example.com/customer">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <cus:GetCustomer>
         <cus:id>123</cus:id>
      </cus:GetCustomer>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
```

## üß≠ When to Use REST vs SOAP?

### ‚úÖ Use **REST** when:
- You need fast and lightweight APIs
- You're building modern web or mobile applications
- Simplicity, speed, and ease of use are important
- Stateless communication is sufficient
- You don‚Äôt require complex contracts or transaction control

### ‚úÖ Use **SOAP** when:
- You're integrating with legacy systems (ERP, banking, government)
- A strict service contract is required (WSDL)
- You need **message-level security** (signatures, encryption)
- Transactions and guaranteed message delivery are essential
- You‚Äôre working in **high-security or enterprise** environments

---

## üìå Summary

- **REST** is ideal for modern, lightweight APIs using HTTP/JSON.
- **SOAP** is preferred for complex, transactional, and secure enterprise integrations.
- REST is easier and faster to implement; SOAP provides more advanced features and strict contracts.
- A good integration developer knows **both approaches** and understands when to use each based on technical and business requirements.
